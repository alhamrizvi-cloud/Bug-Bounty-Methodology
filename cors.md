# What is CORS?

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) controls which external origins can access a web application’s responses. A misconfiguration can let an attacker read sensitive data using a victim’s authenticated session.

## **Corser** (Best Overall – Fast & Accurate)

```bash
corser -i urls.txt -o corser_results.txt
```

## **Corsy** (Best Secondary – Payload-Based)

```bash
python3 corsy.py -i urls.txt -t 20
```
